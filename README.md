# Project_DKE
Code to compute the chromatic number of a graph: 

1) a simple lower bound algorithm
 
2) a simple upper  bound algorithm
 
3) an algorithm calculating the exact chromatic number (which works only for small graphs).



##### About ReadGraph.java : 

The following ready-to-compile piece of Java will read a graph into memory: ReadGraph.java. Your own code can be added at the end of it (see the comments in the code). After compiling the code, you can use it as follows, where graph.txt is the file containing your graph : 

`java ReadGraph graph.txt`


* **Please use comments in your code, as everyone should understand and be able to explain every algorithm** ðŸ˜Š
